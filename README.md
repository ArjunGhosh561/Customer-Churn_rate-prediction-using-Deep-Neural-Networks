# Customer Churn Rate Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a customer churn rate prediction model using deep neural networks. The model utilizes the TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, and Keras libraries to build and train the neural network.

## Installation ##

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git

Install the required dependencies:
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas keras
Navigate to the project directory:
cd customer-churn-prediction
Run the script:
python churn_prediction.py
Usage
To use the customer churn prediction model, follow these steps:

Prepare your customer data in a suitable format. Ensure that the data contains relevant features for churn prediction, such as customer demographics, behavior, and transaction history.

Save your data in a CSV file format.

Modify the churn_prediction.py script to load your data and configure the neural network settings. You may need to adjust the network architecture, hyperparameters, and training configuration based on your specific requirements.

Run the script:
python churn_prediction.py
The script will train the model on your data and generate predictions for customer churn. The results will be displayed in the console and saved to a file for further analysis.
Data
The customer churn rate prediction model requires input data in CSV format. The data should contain customer records with associated features and labels indicating whether the customer churned or not.

Ensure that your data includes relevant features that can provide insights into customer behavior and patterns that may be indicative of churn. Common features used in churn prediction include customer demographics, transaction history, usage patterns, and customer interactions.

Model Architecture
The customer churn prediction model utilizes a deep neural network architecture implemented with the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The model consists of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. The exact architecture can be modified in the churn_prediction.py script to suit your specific requirements.

During training, the model optimizes the network weights using a suitable loss function and employs backpropagation to update the weights iteratively. The model's hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, and activation functions, can be adjusted in the script to achieve optimal performance.

Results
After training the customer churn prediction model, the script will display the evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the model's performance. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of the model in predicting customer churn.

Additionally, the script will generate predictions for customer churn based on the input data. The predictions can be further analyzed to understand the factors influencing churn and make informed business decisions.
